# The-Efficiency-of-machine-learning-Techniques-in-minimizing-Dwell-Time-of-Cyberattacks
This project is part of  Tuwaiq-Bootcamp requirement's
The goal of this project is to minimize the dwell time of cyberattacks. The training/testing dataset are crafted in certain way to suit the project problem. The best models with highest precision score are identified by tuning the hyper parameters of three algorithms. Eventually, the predictions of the best models of unseen test datasets are evaluated using recall and precision metrics . The conclusion is all the built best models are not performing well in detecting the cyberattack early.
